# zomentum-landing-page

This repository aims to practice my skills about how to develop and slicing UI design from figma into responsive web page. I use gulp for task runner, nunjucks for html renderer, and tailwindcss as base css framework with JIT mode is active. For transition and animation, I use AOS (Animate On Scroll) library.

The design and all assets are downloaded from Figma Community. Copyright is owned by author. You could check it out at https://www.figma.com/community/file/827616182756811651
